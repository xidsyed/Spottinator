Audio and Music Streaming Mobile Application. Stream playlists and songs from remote source.

### Firebase 🔥
Uses a firebase remote data source

### Dependency Injection 🗡️
I used some basic dependency injection using daggerhilt, for both my service and the app. 

### Service ⏯️
MediaBrowserService is used to play music along with a MediaBrowser to control the player. Exoplayer is used as the mediaplayer. Best Media Service Practices were used to allow other Media Controllers to attatch to the Media instance
